// Example 1:
//Input: growthPercentages = [-5, -2, 0, 3, 10]
//Output: [0, 4, 9, 25, 100]
//Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [25, 4, 0, 9, 100]. After sorting, it becomes [0, 4, 9, 25, 100].
//Example 2:
//Input: growthPercentages = [-8, -3, 2, 4, 12]
//Output: [4, 9, 16, 64, 144]

// Time Complexity:
//The time complexity of the squareAndSortGrowthPercentages method is dominated by two key operations:
//1.Squaring Each Element: The method iterates over each element in the array and squares it. This operation takes O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array.
//2.Sorting the Array: After squaring, the array is sorted using Arrays.sort(), which has a time complexity of O(nlogn).
//Overall time complexity: O(n \log n).

//Space Complexity:
//The space complexity of the method is as follows:
//1.In-Place Modification: The input array is squared in place, so no extra space is required for squaring the elements.
//2.Sorting: Javaâ€™s Arrays.sort() typically uses O(n) space for temporary storage during sorting.
//Overall space complexity: O(n)

//Summary:
//Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
//Space Complexity: O(n)
